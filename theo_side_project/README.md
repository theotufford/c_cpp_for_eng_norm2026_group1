## game engine
literally the most crude game engine physically possible, also it doesnt work. The game part of it sort of works and I can control an object in space via keyboard input. However, I am attempting to render the game objects on an ascii canvas. Which I think is the least efficient way you could possibly do that.
but its cool that the wasd input works :D. 

I should look into openGL to render like a basic cube moving around on a screen and make snake.

ascii rendering would be pretty cool though.
